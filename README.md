ReverSim is an open-source environment for the browser, originally developed at the 
[Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP)](https://www.mpi-sp.org/)
to study human aspects in hardware reverse engineering.

## Getting Started
You can try out ReverSim on our public demo instance at [beta.hrestudy.com](https://beta.hrestudy.com/index) 

To customize the sequence of tasks, change game rules, or to collect data for your own research, you will have to install the game on your own hardware.\
We provide three ways to install and run the ReverSim server: 

1. With [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (preferred for production use): `docker run -it -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/emsec/reversim:latest`
2. With the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Python debugger (for testing only)
3. From the command prompt (alternative)

You can find out more in our [getting started guide](doc/GettingStarted.md).

For information on how to use the level editor, see [doc/LevelEditor.md](doc/LevelEditor.md).
