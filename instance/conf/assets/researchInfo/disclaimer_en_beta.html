<p><b>Summary</b>
	<ul>
		<li>This is the beta version of our hardware reverse engineering game, ReverSim. We are providing this instance as a freely available test environment.</li>
		<li>During gameplay, we collect pseudonymous logs so that, if your game crashes, we can figure out what happened. These logs do not include your IP address. You get a new pseudonym every time you play, so we can't track you.</li>
		<li>We do not collect any personally identifiable data. Please do not send us any personally identifiable data.</li>
		<li>We might report some aggregated statistics, such as the total number of players or average solution times, in a paper about ReverSim. We will never give anyone else access to the raw data.</li>
		<li>You must be 18 to participate.</li>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Thank you for your interest in our research. To participate in this study, we would like to ask you to read the following information carefully. It will inform you of your rights as a participant and our obligations as study administrators.</p>
<p>The following contents deal with a pilot study on the topic "Simulation of Hardware Reverse Engineering in an Online Gaming Environment". This pilot study is being conducted at the Department of Educational Psychology at the Ruhr University Bochum (Prof. Dr. Nikol Rummel) and at the Max Planck Institute for  Security and Privacy (Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christof Paar).</p>
<p>The goal of the pilot study is to validate the technical implementation of our hardware reverse engineering simulation (ReverSim). The collected data will help us to optimize the game mechanics and discover and remedy potential software errors. This study is intended for individuals who are at least 18 years old.</p>

<h2 id="procedure-of-the-study">Procedure of the study</h2>
<p>The study takes place online, so you can participate using your own device. Participation in the pilot study should take approximately 30-60 minutes if you complete all the tasks. You can participate as many times as you like. A laptop or PC and an Internet connection are mandatory for participation. For technical reasons, participation via smartphone or tablet is not possible.</p>
<p>The pilot study starts with two so-called training and qualification phases, which are an integral part of ReverSim. During the training and qualification phases you can familiarize yourself with all the game elements and the game's objectives, and you will be able to solve first smaller tasks. After completing the training and qualification phases, you can attempt the 12 main tasks of ReverSim.</p>
<p>Your solution paths, your clicks on various game elements (switches in the circuits as well as clicks on all buttons) and your required solution time per task will be saved in the form of pseudonymous log files. These log files are stored during the training and qualification phases as well as during the main tasks. Furthermore, we will save any drawings you create using the painting tools within the circuits.</p>
<p>If you decide to play our game multiple times, we will create a new, independent log file each time.</p>

<h2 id="voluntariness">Voluntariness</h2>
<p>Participation in this pilot study is voluntary. You can withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, without facing any disadvantages.</p>

<h2 id="data-protection-and-right-to-data-deletion">Data protection and right to data deletion</h2>
<p>All data collected as part of the study will be treated confidentially. This data will be stored and analyzed pseudonymously. Pseudonyms are generated by assigning each session a random unique identifier consisting of numbers and letters.</p>
<p>Log files are retained for a maximum of 12 months from the date they were created. You have the right to request the deletion of your data from the log files at any time. This will then be carried out immediately. To do so, please contact Ren√© Walendy (rene.walendy@mpi-sp.org) or Steffen Becker (steffen.becker@rub.de) and provide your unique session identifier.</p>
<p>We do not collect any personal data as part of the study. For example, we do not store your IP address.</p>
<p>All data collected as part of the study will be used for scientific purposes only and stored on a server that complies with German data protection laws. The results and parts of the data from this study may be published as a scientific publication. This will be done in aggregated form, i.e., we will never publish data from individual sessions. Beyond this use, we will never share data of this pilot study with others.</p>
<p>Thus, this study follows the recommendations of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German Psychological Society (DGPs) for quality assurance in research.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions about this pilot study, please feel free to contact us: <br>rene.walendy@mpi-sp.org; steffen.becker@rub.de</p>
